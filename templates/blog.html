            <div>Hello,<br> </div><div>We hope that you've enjoyed a hot and relaxing summer. It's time to resume your monthly burst of good news about <a href="https://janitor.technology" target="_blank">the Janitor</a>.<br> </div><div> </div><div>1) A New Order of Magnitude</div><div> </div><div>Earlier in June, the Janitor greeted its 100th user, and we're now growing fast into the three digits. Today, there are <a href="https://janitor.technology/data/" target="_blank">189</a> of us, and we've collectively landed <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19YhJ_C4VhGtcvzezlhS6UEI5lJYl1LKl5nZwl6c1J-M/present#slide=id.g145d93b56e_0_105" target="_blank">31</a> official code contributions to the <a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/" target="_blank">5</a> supported software projects. Most of them went to Firefox, with Chrome a close second. (Note: If you've made a contribution using the Janitor, please tell me, they're hard to keep track of!)<br> </div><div>Thank you so much for all your enthusiasm and help. It's been an incredible journey so far, but the most exciting is what's yet to come.</div><div><br><br>2) What's Next<br> </div><div>At Mozilla we're currently in talks with Cloud9 to make their IDE even better for Firefox development. We'd love to build a dedicated <a href="https://ide.firefox.com" target="_blank">ide.firefox.com</a> service (domain pending) that would be accessible to any developer in just a single click. Then we'd like to expand this concept to other projects, with additional services like <a href="https://ide.servo.org" target="_blank">ide.servo.org</a> and <a href="https://ide.rust-lang.org" target="_blank">ide.rust-lang.org</a> (domains pending) that should all work seamlessly with the Janitor. And to support these at scale, we'll move your back-end Docker containers onto a more powerful cloud platform.<br> </div><div>Expect open source contributions to become ever easier with the Janitor, thanks to quick and intuitive UX integrations. For example, you should soon be able to send a patch for review directly from your IDE interface, or trigger an automated test run on your code, or even debug it step-by-step to look for bugs, and all these helpers will work simply with the click of a button.</div><div><br><br>3) Fixing Account Problems<br> </div><div>A few things have changed in the way Janitor Alpha accounts are set up. A separate Cloud9 account is still required, but it appears that Cloud9 asks for your credit card now, even for free accounts. I don't know why they chose to do this, but I'm sorry for that experience.<br> </div><div>If you're having trouble getting the Janitor to work, please make sure that you've added both your Cloud9 username and Cloud9 SSH public key to your Janitor <a href="https://janitor.technology/account/" target="_blank">account</a>. Adding your username will enable your Cloud9 account to work with the Janitor (this can take a short while, because I need to add you to our sponsored Team Account manually) while adding Cloud9's SSH public key will authorize their IDE to access your Janitor environments via SSH (without that, the IDE part won't work).</div><div><br> </div><div>4) Janitor Events</div><div> </div><div>Here is a recap of all Janitor-related events that happened since the last newsletter, or that will be coming soon.<br> </div><div>June 13-17, 2016: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/2016_London" target="_blank">Mozilla All Hands</a> in London<br>- I held two sessions where Mozillians could learn more about the Janitor. High five if you were there!<br>- Here are the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19YhJ_C4VhGtcvzezlhS6UEI5lJYl1LKl5nZwl6c1J-M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">slides</a> I presented.<br>- The room was not equipped for recording, but we shot a <a href="https://youtu.be/lOWt9-dB-Z4" target="_blank">video</a> anyway.<br> </div><div>August 27, 2016: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Japan/Gecko_inside" target="_blank">Gecko Inside</a> in Tokyo<br>- During the next monthly community event at Mozilla Japan, there will be a Firefox Hackathon.<br>- Mantaroh will tell attendees about the Janitor, and anyone interested will be able to try it.<br> </div><div>October 28-30, 2016: <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/" target="_blank">MozFest</a> in London<br>- Each year, the Mozilla Festival is abuzz with exciting people and sessions.<br>- I offered to host a Firefox contribution workshop using the Janitor.<br>- I'll let you know if they accept.</div><div> </div><div>And that's it for today. If you missed any previous "Janitor News" email, they're now permanently available <a href="https://janitor.technology/blog/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br><br>Stay tuned for more progress soon,<br>Jan</div>

            <div dir="ltr">Hi there,<div><br></div><div><div>Thanks a lot for being a pioneer in trying to change the way we do software development! The Janitor&#39;s alpha version is doing great, and things are already shaping up fast toward the beta.</div><div><br></div><div>It&#39;s very exciting to see this vision becoming reality, and you&#39;re making it happen. The Janitor currently has 31 confirmed users (15 on waitlist) and supports 6 large open source projects (<a href="https://janitor.technology/data/" target="_blank">source</a>).</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div># Scaling to Multiple Servers</div><div><br></div><div>The back-end code is currently being rewritten to use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/" target="_blank">Docker Remote API</a>. This will allow exciting improvements, like running multiple Docker servers in parallel, and more control for you on your&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/contributions/" target="_blank">contributions</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Warning: I will do my best to make this transition seamless, but there is a slight risk of losing some containers in the process. <b>Please back up your work!</b></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><div># Project Dockerfiles</div><div><br></div><div>All the projects available on the Janitor have a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target="_blank">Dockerfile</a>&nbsp;that describes a Linux environment suitable for their developers. Writing one is basically all it takes to add a new project to the Janitor. A few examples:</div><div><br></div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/firefox.docker" target="_blank">Firefox dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/firefox/" target="_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://imagelayers.io/?images=janx%2Ffirefox:latest">image size</a>.</div></div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/chromium.docker" target="_blank">Chrome dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/chromium/" target="_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://imagelayers.io/?images=janx%2Fchromium:latest">image size</a>.</div><div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/thunderbird.docker" target="_blank">Thunderbird dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/thunderbird/" target="_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://imagelayers.io/?images=janx%2Fthunderbird:latest">image size</a>.</div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/servo.docker" target="_blank">Servo dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/servo/" target="_blank">build times</a>.</div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/rcatolino/kdesrcbuild-docker/blob/master/kde.docker" target="_blank">KDE dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/kde/" target="_blank">build times</a>.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div># More Invites Coming Soon</div><div><br></div><div>Invites used to work like this: Users created a Cloud9 account, I asked Cloud9 to upgrade them to premium for free, and finally I sent out a Janitor invite. While this was great to get started quickly, it obviously doesn&#39;t scale. I&#39;m currently working with Cloud9 on a better solution that won&#39;t require premium accounts.</div><div><br></div><div>It goes without saying that the Janitor will always be <b>free for open source</b> contributors, but in the meantime if you already have a <a href="https://c9.io/pricing/webide">Cloud9 premium</a> account, please let me know (I can invite you right now).</div></div><div><div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>That&#39;s it for today! If you have any question, or if you&#39;d like to help, please reach out. The Janitor is <a href="https://github.com/jankeromnes/janitor">on GitHub</a>, and we also have an <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=janitor">IRC channel</a> on freenode.</div><div><br></div><div>Keep in touch,</div><div>Jan</div></div></div>
