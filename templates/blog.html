            <div dir=3D"ltr">Hi there,<div><br></div><div><div>Thanks a lot for being a pioneer in trying to change the way we do software development! The Janitor&#39;s alpha version is doing great, and things are already shaping up fast toward the beta.</div><div><br></div><div>It&#39;s very exciting to see this vision becoming reality, and you&#39;re making it happen. The Janitor currently has 31 confirmed users (15 on waitlist) and supports 6 large open source projects (<a href=3D"https://janitor.technology/data/" target=3D"_blank">source</a>).</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div># Scaling to Multiple Servers</div><div><br></div><div>The back-end code is currently being rewritten to use the <a href=3D"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/" target=3D"_blank">Docker Remote API</a>. This will allow exciting improvements, like running multiple Docker servers in parallel, and more control for you on your&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://janitor.technology/contributions/" target=3D"_blank">contributions</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Warning: I will do my best to make this transition seamless, but there is a slight risk of losing some containers in the process. <b>Please back up your work!</b></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><div># Project Dockerfiles</div><div><br></div><div>All the projects available on the Janitor have a&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target=3D"_blank">Dockerfile</a>&nbsp;that describes a Linux environment suitable for their developers. Writing one is basically all it takes to add a new project to the Janitor. A few examples:</div><div><br></div><div>-&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/firefox.docker" target=3D"_blank">Firefox dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://janitor.technology/projects/firefox/" target=3D"_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://imagelayers.io/?images=3Djanx%2Ffirefox:latest">image size</a>.</div></div>-&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/chromium.docker" target=3D"_blank">Chrome dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://janitor.technology/projects/chromium/" target=3D"_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://imagelayers.io/?images=3Djanx%2Fchromium:latest">image size</a>.</div><div><div>-&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/thunderbird.docker" target=3D"_blank">Thunderbird dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://janitor.technology/projects/thunderbird/" target=3D"_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://imagelayers.io/?images=3Djanx%2Fthunderbird:latest">image size</a>.</div><div>-&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://github.com/jankeromnes/dockerfiles/blob/master/servo.docker" target=3D"_blank">Servo dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://janitor.technology/projects/servo/" target=3D"_blank">build times</a>.</div><div>-&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://github.com/rcatolino/kdesrcbuild-docker/blob/master/kde.docker" target=3D"_blank">KDE dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://janitor.technology/projects/kde/" target=3D"_blank">build times</a>.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div># More Invites Coming Soon</div><div><br></div><div>Invites used to work like this: Users created a Cloud9 account, I asked Cloud9 to upgrade them to premium for free, and finally I sent out a Janitor invite. While this was great to get started quickly, it obviously doesn&#39;t scale. I&#39;m currently working with Cloud9 on a better solution that won&#39;t require premium accounts.</div><div><br></div><div>It goes without saying that the Janitor will always be <b>free for open source</b> contributors, but in the meantime if you already have a <a href=3D"https://c9.io/pricing/webide">Cloud9 premium</a> account, please let me know (I can invite you right now).</div></div><div><div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>That&#39;s it for today! If you have any question, or if you&#39;d like to help, please reach out. The Janitor is <a href=3D"https://github.com/jankeromnes/janitor">on GitHub</a>, and we also have an <a href=3D"https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=3Djanitor">IRC channel</a> on freenode.</div><div><br></div><div>Keep in touch,</div><div>Jan<br><br></div></div></div>
